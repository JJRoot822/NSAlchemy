# NSAlchemy
## A Package of Useful macOS Controls for SwiftUI

### What is NSAlchemy?

NSAlchemy is a Swift package that contains a few useful views for developing macOS apps that SwiftUI doesn't have equivalents for yet or who's native SwiftUI counterparts perform badly in common use cases.
As of December 14, 2024, the package contains the following views:
- HSlider: A horizontal slider with various customization options including tick marks and the ability to change the track color.
- VSlider: A vertical slider that has the same customization options as HSlider, but is oriented vertically.
- CircularSlider: A Circular slider that has a few options to customize it, but not as much as the previous mentioned ones. This slider acts much more like a knob.
- LevelIndicator: A view that can reflect capacity levels or ratings. This view contains many customizations, including the ability to change the colors for warning and critical levels for the capacity style indicator and the ability to use custom assets for the rating images.
- PathControl: A simple view that displays a visual representation of the path to a file.
